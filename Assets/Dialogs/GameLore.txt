1. Introduction Dialogue
(The game begins in a dimly lit church. A shadowy figure—the Necromancer—emerges from the mist.)

Necromancer:
"Ah… you’ve arrived at last. This cursed place has been waiting for you. The dead whisper your name, but their voices are trapped behind the veil. To move forward, you must listen to their stories… and uncover what binds them here. The answers lie beyond the altar. Go now—before the night claims you as well."

(The Necromancer vanishes into the fog.)

2. Dialogue Hinting to Go to the Altar
(As the player explores the church, the Necromancer’s voice echoes faintly:)

Necromancer (whispering):
"The altar… it holds the first truth. Place your hand upon it, and the path will reveal itself."

3. Altar Interaction Dialogue
(Upon interacting with the altar, an eerie glow illuminates an inscription:)

Altar Inscription:
"The gate to the tomb is sealed, but the dead remember the key. Five souls rest here, each holding a fragment of the past. Listen to their tales, and the word of passage shall be yours."

4. Tombstone Dialogues (Letters: D, E, A, T, H)
Tombstone 1 (D):
"I was a scholar, consumed by my thirst for forbidden knowledge. The Necromancer offered me power… but his magic turned my bones to dust. Remember me… and take this: D."

Tombstone 2 (E):
"A knight, sworn to protect the innocent. Yet when the undead rose, my blade failed me. The Necromancer’s curse left me to rot in my own armor. My gift to you: E."

Tombstone 3 (A):
"A thief, I was. Thought I could steal from death itself. The Necromancer caught me… and made me part of his collection. Take this letter, and flee while you can: A."

Tombstone 4 (T):
"A priestess, I prayed for salvation. But the Necromancer’s curse twisted my faith into despair. Now, I am but a voice in the wind. Hear me: T."

Tombstone 5 (H):
"A child, lost in the fog. The Necromancer promised to lead me home… but home was never real. Remember my name… and take this: H."

5. Gate Opening Dialogue
(After entering "DEATH," the gate creaks open, revealing a descending path.)

Necromancer (echoing):
"You’ve done well… but the true test lies ahead. Enter, and face what you have wrought."

6. Tomb Chamber Dialogue (Minigame Instruction)
(Inside, the Necromancer’s tomb sits between two glowing altars.)

Necromancer (voice booming):
"Two altars remain, each a piece of the curse that binds me—and you. Solve their puzzles, and the cycle ends. Fail… and you join the others forever."

7. Endgame Dialogue
(After completing the minigames, the Necromancer’s form shatters, revealing a ghastly truth.)

Necromancer (fading, now in the player’s own voice):
"At last… you see. You were never the living. You are the last soul trapped here—my soul. The curse is broken… and we… are… free."

(The screen fades to white as the tomb crumbles into dust.)
